Web App E-Commerce

Undertaking the development of "Dora la Vendedora" has been an exhilarating journey, especially considering that it was my final project for a web app development course. 

The concept behind this endeavor was to simulate an e-commerce store, albeit with a delightful twist. Inspired by my passion for humor and creativity, I decided to focus on an unconventional niche - selling quirky mascot costumes. Thus, "Dora la Vendedora" was born, and with it, the opportunity to apply my knowledge of PHP, HTML, and Bootstrap in a real-world context.

While the project is already functional, it continues to evolve. I view it as a canvas for learning and innovation, where I can experiment with different features and enhance the overall user experience. "Dora la Vendedora" is more than just an e-commerce website; it's a testament to the fusion of imagination, sense of humor and practicality.
